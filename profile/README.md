# 🧠 Mira AI – Open-Source Indian AI Initiative  

Welcome to **Mira AI**, an initiative by **MegaVault.IN** to build India's **first open-source AI dataset and AI-powered tools**. Our mission is to create **unbiased AI models** that accurately represent **Indian history, culture, and languages** while ensuring **openness, transparency, and accessibility** for everyone.  

## 🌟 Why Mira AI?  
🚀 **Bridging the AI Gap** – Existing AI models rely on **Western-centric datasets** that lack accurate **Indian historical and cultural perspectives**.  
🌏 **Open-Source & Community-Driven** – AI should be **transparent** and **accessible**. We are building a **fully open-source ecosystem**.  
📚 **Multilingual & Inclusive** – AI should **understand and process Indian languages** effectively.  
🔬 **Innovation & Research** – We aim to **power AI applications** with **India-focused datasets** and **domain-specific models**.
